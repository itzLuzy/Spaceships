### Description
The program displays a group of 2D space ships and a bunch of randomly generated stars going from top to bottom of the screen, giving the illusion of movement on the ships.

Every object displayed on screen is created using pyglet shapes and batches.

You can also move the main ship with the keyboard arrows and the rest of them will follow with a certain delay. The screen is resizable.
